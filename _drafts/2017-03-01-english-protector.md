A `Hubot` extension created to fightback from the Americanisation of the English language. "How can we expect Americans to get the spelling of an individual `colour` correct, when they spell the collective wrong!"

Ok, Ok, calm down, Hopefully you can tell from the tone of the blog so far, that this is a bit of joke and some friendly Banter between the English and American teams.

[Here](https://github.com/lashford/hubot-st-george) is the code.

### HuBot


### Deployment


### Custom extension



Thanks again,
